	* coherence/upnp/core/ssdp.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_renderer.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: make some local device
	  and service registrations ''silent'', meaning not announcing them
	  via SSDP alive notification messages, but still answer for
	  MSEARCH requests.
	  
	  This should solve an issue causing the PS3 to overbalance when
	  getting notification messages from the same device for different
	  device versions.

2007-06-10 14:52  dev

	* coherence/backends/fs_storage.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/DIDLLite.py: revert some changes made during
	  the PS3 tests which seem to be unnecessary

2007-06-10 10:46  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/service.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: fixes some wrong
	  assumption about an int really being one

2007-06-09 15:18  dev

2007-05-24 19:44  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_renderer.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: enable support for device
	  icons
	  
	  configuration isn't yet optimal - in the section of the
	  MediaServer or MediaRenderer backend in the config file we need
	  something like this:
	  
	  {{{
	  [[[icon]]]
	  mimetype = image/png
	  height = 48
	  width = 48
	  depth = 24
	  url = file:///home/dev/elisa/elisa.png
	  }}}
	  
	  or in the config dict:
	  
	  {{{
	  'icon': { 'url':'http://coherence.beebits.net/image.png',
	  'mimetype': 'image/png',
	  'width':120,
	  'height':120,
	  'depth':24
	  }
	  }}}
	  
	  According to the
	  [http://upnp.org/specs/arch/UPnP-DeviceArchitecture-v1.0-20060720.pdf
	  UPnP Device Architecture p.28] all fields are required. Maybe
	  later Coherence can autogenerate the values with a PIL call.
	  
	  Multiple icons are supported to. The config above has to be
	  wrapped into an '''icons''' section or dictionary, and the
	  '''icon''' has to be replaced with an unique name.

2007-05-21 12:40  dev

	* coherence/backends/elisa_storage.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/DIDLLite.py: enable the Elisa MediaServer to
	  supply cover images too

2007-05-20 19:03  dev

	* coherence/backends/mediadb_storage.py: use other id3 tag library
	  ([http://pyid3lib.sourceforge.net pyid3lib]) if available, as
	  requested by konttori

2007-05-20 19:00  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: small cleanup

2007-05-20 18:59  dev

	* coherence/extern/covers_by_amazon.py: * works now with artist and
	  title in unicode
	  * typo fix

2007-05-19 09:53  dev

	* coherence/backends/mediadb_storage.py: this is a comment addon
	  for [449]
	  
	  * added the image extension to the cover request uri, so clients
	  like the Nokia Media Streamer - which determine the image type by
	  extension and ignore the mimetype - can handle it. This closes
	  #78
	  
	  * reworked the container structure and added an "All tracks of
	  <artist>" at the beginning of the Artist container

2007-05-19 09:43  dev

	* coherence/backends/mediadb_storage.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: adapt the recognition of
	  a request for cover art to the new uri with the image extension
	  added, addresses #78

2007-05-19 09:41  dev

2007-05-17 19:55  dev

	* coherence/backends/mediadb_storage.py: * made the MediaStore a
	  working MediaServer backend
	  * added album art/cover image support

2007-05-17 19:52  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: adjustments to work with
	  the MediaStore backend and to support album art/cover retrieval

2007-05-17 19:46  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/DIDLLite.py: extend MusicTrack with
	  'upnp:albumArtURI' attribute, which could move up to Item anyway

2007-05-17 19:41  dev

	* coherence/extern/covers_by_amazon.py: allow keeping the received
	  image in memory or converting it into a different format with
	  [http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm PIL]

2007-05-17 12:18  dev

	* coherence/backends/buzztard_control.py,
	  coherence/backends/flickr_storage.py,
	  coherence/backends/fs_storage.py,
	  coherence/upnp/services/servers/content_directory_server.py: use
	  methods to access the MediaServer item attributes, allowing the
	  item to create them on the fly

2007-05-17 12:16  dev

	* setup.py: add the new MediaStore backend to the MediaServer
	  entrypoints

2007-05-17 11:55  dev

	* coherence/extern/logger.py: got it right this time? :-/

2007-05-17 11:40  dev

	* coherence/extern/logger.py: handle unicode log msg arguments

2007-05-13 20:17  dev

	* coherence/backends/mediadb_storage.py: first version of a
	  MediaStore with a database backend, provides some basic internal
	  functionality, but far from complete

2007-05-13 19:37  dev

	* coherence/extern/covers_by_amazon.py: deal a bit better with the
	  filename extension

2007-05-12 20:30  dev

	* coherence/extern/covers_by_amazon.py: now callback handling with
	  parameter passing

2007-05-12 11:23  dev

	* coherence/extern/covers_by_amazon.py: added a callback parameter,
	  so the initiator will get informed when an image retrieval has
	  succeeded

2007-05-12 10:57  dev

	* coherence/extern/covers_by_amazon.py: a small helper module to
	  retrieve covers/album-art via the Amazon ECommerce Webservice
	  with Twisted
	  
	  * works for ASIN and ARTIST/TITLE
	  * saves the retrieved image in a file
	  * includes a small Queue module to reduce the number of parallel
	  requests

2007-05-10 16:30  dev

	* coherence/extern/inotify.py: added system call ids for ARM/Maemo
	  platform

2007-05-10 16:29  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/event.py: reduce the amount of log output

2007-05-07 20:21  dev

	* coherence/backends/gstreamer_audio_player.py, setup.py: rework of
	  the GStreamer MediaRenderer
	  
	  supports ogg now and works way better on the N800 (still a few
	  issues open, e.g. seems to stop sending UPnP events)
	  
	  re #74

2007-05-07 08:28  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/service.py: store the information about
	  vendor defines in the ''allowed value range'' too

2007-05-07 08:26  dev

	* coherence/backends/fs_storage.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/DIDLLite.py: adaption for ogg-files

2007-05-05 13:31  dev

	* coherence/__init__.py, coherence/base.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/device.py, coherence/upnp/core/event.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/service.py, coherence/upnp/core/ssdp.py: Fix
	  the shutdown method of Coherence, the
	  ''reactor.addSystemEventTrigger( 'before', 'shutdown',
	  self.shutdown)'' expects self.shutdown to return a deferred and
	  waits until that has finished.
	  
	  Now we return a
	  [http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/defer.html#auto7
	  deferredList] in which we collect and wait for all cleanups that
	  have to be done.
	  
	  In addition the way the event unsubscription had to be changed. A
	  new EventProtocol instance seems not to be created by the
	  ClientCreater when the reactor is going down. Which makes some
	  sense anyway. :-)
	  
	  So we keep the protocol instance after our first event
	  subscription request for reuse around and are now able to send
	  out the unsubscribe request.
	  
	  This fixes #75 - at least it is supposed to. If not pls reopen
	  this ticket.

2007-05-04 10:51  dev

	* coherence/backends/flickr_storage.py: Flickr seems to have
	  changed the way original photos can be retrieved.
	  
	  [http://flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html Flickr Photo
	  Source URLs]
	  
	  To access the original photos, we need to construct the url with
	  an ''originalsecret'', which isn't returned in the response to
	  our current request.
	  
	  So for now we just take the default image (medium resolution?)
	  that Flickr offers and try to sort out later what's needed to
	  retrieve that ''originalsecret'' value.
	  
	  This closes #73.

2007-04-16 19:03  dev

	  This addresses #36, but we need for this to work properly some
	  additional mapping supplied by the backend to tell which of the

	  supports.
	  
	  Added a method to browse the content of the Flickr backend.
	  This should evolve in some future into something that allows
	  browser access to any of the non-filesystem backends.

2007-01-19 14:17  dev

	* coherence/backends/flickr_storage.py,
	  docs/coherence.conf.example: first usable Flickr backend

2007-01-19 14:16  dev

	* coherence/base.py: one more debug output line

2007-01-19 14:15  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/service.py: some minor adjustments on how

2007-01-18 22:54  dev

2007-01-18 08:32  dev

	* docs/coherence.conf.example: put 'serverport' into

2007-01-18 08:24  dev

	* coherence/base.py: added configuration option 'serverport' to

	  react on control requests or event subscriptions, and to
	  distribute content.

2007-01-17 10:49  dev

	* coherence/base.py, coherence/upnp/core/utils.py: being a little

2007-01-16 13:12  haiku

	* coherence/backends/elisa_storage.py, coherence/base.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/utils.py: - Updated Elisa storage to work

	  - Config now accepts an interface parameter, to provide the

2007-01-09 15:02  dev

	* coherence/backends/gstreamer_audio_player.py,

	  more fixes re proper volume control of the Gstreamer
	  MediaRenderer
	  
	  - added the channel attribute
	  - send the allowedValueRange with the service description
	  unfortunately the Intel CP still sends strange values

2007-01-09 14:59  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/xml-service-descriptions/RenderingControl2.xml:
	  a try to hint the dependency between the audio related
	  StateVariables and the channel list

2007-01-09 10:28  dev

	* coherence/backends/gstreamer_audio_player.py: fix for stupid typo

2007-01-08 17:31  dev

	* coherence/backends/gstreamer_audio_player.py: adjustments for

2007-01-08 17:29  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/variable.py: add another value to the list to
	  determine boolean True

	* coherence/backends/gstreamer_audio_player.py, coherence/base.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/service.py, coherence/upnp/core/variable.py:
	  This adds Volume and Mute control to the GStreamer MediaRenderer
	  backend.
	  
	  And a first method for a backend to overwrite the vendor defines
	  in the xml-service-descriptions.

2007-01-07 15:25  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/service.py, coherence/upnp/core/variable.py,
	  coherence/upnp/services/servers/connection_manager_server.py:
	  remove a connection from the ConnectionManager after 300 seconds
	  of inactivity - which is currently synonymous to no change of a

	  Enable several instances per MediaRenderer.
	  
	  We still need to find a way to actually tell the
	  ConnectionManager if the backend supports this!
	  
	  Adapting the MediaServer to these changes and some cosmetic fixes
	  in the xml-service-descriptions.
	  
	  This also closes #45.

2007-01-06 20:56  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_renderer.py: use the backend
	  parameter

2007-01-06 20:53  dev

	  action callbacks.
	  
	  If the action is optional, just don't provide it.
	  If it is a required action, don't activate the service.
	  
	  If that service is a required one, this will lead to an abort of
	  the device
	  instantiation.
	  
	  We need an overwrite for this to create in the TestSuite
	  nonconformity devices/services.
	  
	  This closes #25.

2006-12-21 15:59  dev

	* coherence/extern/logger.py: some more logger functionality

2006-12-21 15:56  dev

	* coherence/backends/fs_storage.py: temporally add
	  upnp_GetCurrentConnectionInfo to the backend until we have a
	  solution for #45.

2006-12-20 18:21  dev

	* bin/coherence, coherence/base.py: made the backend passing to the
	  Coherence class a little bit more reasonable/readable - advice by
	  philn

2006-12-20 17:14  dev

	* bin/coherence, coherence/backends/fs_storage.py,
	  coherence/backends/gstreamer_audio_player.py, coherence/base.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_renderer.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: Some first steps in the
	  direction of a plugin system.
	  
	  Let the backends be the only visible things outside of Coherence!
	  
	  We should now be able to add and activate a plugin an startup
	  and, in the next steps, later via the WebUI too, and retrieve
	  from somewhere the configuration for each plugin.
	  
	  And this foundation should be extendable for .egg plugins too.

2006-12-18 22:28  dev

	* bin, bin/coherence, coherence.py, coherence/base.py: Moved
	  Coherence class into the coherence package and the coherence.py
	  into bin/coherence.
	  
	  Added a plugins parameter to Coherence, where a list of classes
	  can be handed over for instantiation.
	  And an add_plugin method to add one later.

2006-12-17 22:34  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/event.py,

	  Everything that was needed to get recognized by the Intel
	  ControlPoint.
	  An audio file will be played and progress displayed on the
	  ControlPoint.
	  Pause, Start and Stop seem to work.
	  
	  There is an issue left on EOS and resetting the
	  CurrentTransportActions.
	  
	  This addresses #38 again.

2006-12-17 19:37  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: small fix and more
	  parameters on the call to
	  connection_manager_server.add_connection

2006-12-17 12:43  dev

	* coherence/backends/gstreamer_audio_player.py,
	  coherence/upnp/services/servers/connection_manager_server.py:
	  changes for a better spec compliance, but either we are still
	  missing some things or maybe the Intel ControlPoint expects
	  something out of the usual way?
	  
	  Need to check and compare this with a working MediaRenderer.

2006-12-17 12:40  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/variable.py: wrong check for last_change
	  attribute, surfaced due to the updates with the new default

	  coherence/upnp/core/soap_service.py,

2006-12-17 12:35  dev

	  configurable logging function:
	  
	  * enable/disable per module
	  * set log level per module
	  
	  This addresses #15.

	  coherence/upnp/core/xml-service-descriptions/ContentDirectory2.xml,
	  coherence/upnp/core/xml-service-descriptions/RenderingControl2.xml:
	  a whole bunch of changes in the xml service descriptions
	  regarding default values and the definition of all allowed
	  values.
	  
	  Plus a our very first '''own''' vendor extension
	  
	  ''coherence:X_withVendorDefines = "True|False"''
	  
	  which defines if a value in
	  
	  * a allowedValueList and
	  * a allowedValueRange
	  
	  can be extended by a vendor.
	  
	  This is currently used only in the description files used for
	  service creation, but it could be inserted into the description
	  files we send out to other devices too.
	  
	  This changeset fixes #37 and #38.

2006-12-13 17:27  dev

	* coherence/backends/fs_storage.py: small self-test change

	* python-upnp/elisa_storage.py: item.res.size is an optional
	  attribute -as the Elisa MediaStore isn't (yet) providing it, it

	  MediaStore.

2006-11-26 18:01  dev

	* python-upnp/elisa_storage.py, python-upnp/media_server.py: dumb

	* python-upnp/connection_manager_server.py,

2006-11-26 16:19  dev

	* python-upnp/service.py: fix soap_generic in such a way, that the
	  action.callback as intended can actually return a deferred or a
	  result-dict

2006-11-26 15:35  philn

	* python-upnp/elisa_storage.py, python-upnp/soap_service.py: Some

2006-11-24 15:13  dev

	* python-upnp/fs_storage.py: some forgotten import

	  enhancements regarding a working MediaServer.
	  
	  Some of them concerning the different namespace, which refs to
	  #28.
	  
	  Fixed an embarrassingly stupid bug in the device registration,
	  where we had the services url in the location header of the
	  service notification, instead of the url for the device
	  description.xml, this is one of those that fixes #26.
	  
	  This only showed up due to the fact that the Noxon-2 looks only
	  for service notifications.
	  
	  Version 2 devices now send out notifications for devices v1 and
	  services v1 too. Requisite for this are different device
	  descriptions accordingly to the version, pointing to the matching
	  services.

	* python-upnp/media_receiver_registrar_server.py,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/X_MS_MediaReceiverRegistrar1.xml:
	  This adds a MediaReceiverRegistrar with a FakeBackend, that just
	  affirms any IsAuthorized and IsValidated actions.

2006-11-19 16:41  dev

	* python-upnp/coherence.py, python-upnp/fs_storage.py,

	  python-upnp/media_server.py,
	  python-upnp/rendering_control_server.py, python-upnp/service.py:
	  First 'usable' approach to couple the action callbacks with the
	  methods the backend provides.
	  
	  We still need 'some' knowledge about UPnP in the backend, maybe
	  this can be reduced further.

2006-11-17 11:30  dev

	* python-upnp/content_directory_server.py,
	  python-upnp/fs_storage.py, python-upnp/media_server.py: first

	* python-upnp/content_directory.py: removed as this is only needed
	  with the elisa UPnP plugin

2006-11-17 11:14  dev

	* python-upnp/soap_service.py: fix UPnPPublisher to get the
	  'soap'generic' function actually working with IN arguments

2006-11-09 10:50  dev

	* python-upnp/coherence.py: no need to check for re-subscriptions
	  immediately, wait for the first looping call to pass

2006-11-09 10:47  dev

	* python-upnp/ssdp.py: don't (re)send notifications immediately,

	  fixed in the event notification stuff that showed up on the first
	  tests.

2006-11-07 14:54  dev

	* python-upnp/service.py: error checks in `soap__generic` for wrong
	  or missing IN arguments

2006-11-07 14:42  dev

	* python-upnp/soap_service.py: Proper error-code for 'method not

	* python-upnp/uuid.py: Adjusted copyright just to be sure

2006-10-26 15:30  dev

	* python-upnp/media_server.py, python-upnp/uuid.py: Moved

	  Not sure if the str(instance) approach via __repr__ is sacrosanct
	  or if a self.uuid.get_uuid() construct is a better way to handle
	  this.

2006-10-23 11:14  dev

	  Functionality is still missing!!!
	  
	  Removed an obsolete argument from EventServer `__init__`.
	  
	  Addresses #11.

2006-10-14 14:39  dev

	* python-upnp/ssdp.py: Reworked the SSDP server implementation.
	  
	  The dict items, that represent discovered remote or registered
	  local devices have now a manifestation attribute to distinguish
	  between local or remote devices.
	  
	  We do now resend notifications every 770 seconds.
	  These resends seem to be 'best practice' in case some
	  ControlPoint had missed the discovery responses.
	  
	  Talking of these, discovery responses are now implemented too.
	  
	  Notifications and discovery responses are only send out for local
	  devices.

2006-10-14 14:31  dev

	* python-upnp/service.py: commented out noisy print

2006-10-14 14:30  dev

	* python-upnp/coherence.py: commented out noisy print

2006-10-14 14:24  dev

	* python-upnp/msearch.py: Adjust loop time for msearch, now do
	  searches every 120 seconds.
	  Maybe that's still too often.
	  
	  Add the manifestation argument to the SSDP.register call and
	  modified the licence.

2006-10-14 14:17  dev

	* python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/AVTransport2.xml,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/ConnectionManager2.xml,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/ContentDirectory2.xml,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/MediaRenderer2.xml,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/MediaServer2.xml,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/RenderingControl2.xml,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/ScheduledRecording1.xml:
	  Actually it is a good idea to use the correct xml files if you
	  want to support MediaServer V2 and MediaRenderer V2 ;-)
	  
	  This is an supplement to [25] and addresses #10 again.

2006-10-13 09:56  dev

	* python-upnp/variable.py: adjust faulty argument order in
	  StateVariable init

2006-10-12 14:48  dev

	* python-upnp/connection_manager_server.py,
	  python-upnp/content_directory_server.py,
	  python-upnp/media_server.py: Add and integrate
	  content_directory_server.py on the way to a working basic
	  MediaServer.
	  
	  Some of the changes in media_server.py in the device xml
	  description generation close #10.

2006-10-12 13:35  dev

	* python-upnp/action.py, python-upnp/coherence.py,
	  python-upnp/connection_manager_server.py,
	  python-upnp/media_server.py, python-upnp/service.py,
	  python-upnp/soap_service.py, python-upnp/variable.py,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/AVTransport1.xml,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/ConnectionManager1.xml,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/ContentDirectory1.xml,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/RenderingControl1.xml:
	  Reverted the way the WebInterface is handled and add some simple
	  page-generation to allow easier browsing of the children.
	  
	  Included the xml-services-descriptions directory and use the xml
	  files therein as the source for the server services definition.
	  
	  This addresses #10.
	  
	  And finally added connection_manager_server.py and
	  soap_service.py for an initial test of a server service.

2006-10-11 16:50  dev

	* python-upnp/coherence.py, python-upnp/control_point.py,
	  python-upnp/device.py, python-upnp/media_server.py,
	  python-upnp/service.py, python-upnp/ssdp.py,
	  python-upnp/utils.py: Another big one which removes the blocking
	  urllib2.urlopen call
	  and adds signal based propagation of events, e.g. SSDP
	  new_device,
	  to get around too much deferred wizardry in the device,sub-device
	  and service detection.
	  
	  This introduces [http://pylouie.org louie] as signal dispatcher.

2006-10-09 09:52  dev

	* python-upnp/coherence.py, python-upnp/control_point.py,
	  python-upnp/event.py, python-upnp/rpc_client.py,
	  python-upnp/ssdp.py: This is a big changeset that turns upside
	  down a lot of
	  how the parts within the UPnP framework are dealt with.
	  
	  There is now an embracement class called Coherence that
	  deals with all the parts needed to run an UPnP service.
	  And allows in the future a more plugin based structure.
	  
	  There we decide whether we only want to be a ControlPoint,
	  only a MediaRenderer, only a MediaServer or any combination
	  of these.
	  
	  The SSDP and the MSEARCH subsystems have now their home there.
	  
	  And only one webserver instance is created where all the other
	  subsystems can register their services as childs.
	  
	  For example the ControlPoint appends there its Event Notification
	  service and its XMLRPC interface.
	  And of course it can append there its own web-interface.
	  
	  Likewise for the MediaServer. It appends its XML files,
	  the Event Subscription service, the SOAP interface and its
	  media files.
	  
	  Hopefully not to many things broke with this changeset,
	  actually and intendedly we should be on the same functionality
	  level like before.
